</p>

## PURPOSE
This app allows you some basic information about selected pokémon. 8-)
The items available in this version are:
+ name: Name of the pokémon
+ sprite (front default): only front sprite is displayed even though the API contains several sprites of each pokémon.
+ effects: a brief description of the fighting habilities of the pokémon.

## TECHNOLOGY
The API consumption is made by asynchronous calls with *JavaScript*.  In this case
*async-await* and *fetch* function was used for information retrieval.

## SCOPE
In order to keep the code as simple as possible, no validation nor error catching
routines have been included.  :cry:

## LIMITATIONS
+ This app is only intended for small screen devices.  No efforts have been made for
responsive design. 
+ Original sprites have a very low resolution and no efforts have been made to
  improve it.
